Hello My name is Divyanshi Maurya. I am in B.Tech 1st Semester.
I made this project on a Real life based problem for Windows Users- The download File.
As a Windows OS User, We tend to download several files from the Internet to the Downloads folder. If we examine the contents of our Downloads folder we might find various files in diverse formats like MP3, xlsx, PDF, docs, srt, Zip etc. These files can populate our C drive, and then you start moving the files from the Downloads folder to other folders, which can be a very tiresome and monotonous task.

So I have created this project keeping this in my mind.
Glad to be your help.
